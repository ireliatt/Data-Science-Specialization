### Hey, I'm been missing my life in university terribly. 
#### This map shows where we lived, where we studied, where we drank, where I worked and where we did workout. Basically Edinburgh is my second hometown. It's really beautiful. 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
EdinIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7a/University_of_Edinburgh_ceremonial_roundel.svg",
  iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31,
  iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16
)

Names <- c("Home","Main Library", "Appleton Tower", "Stack Dim Sum Bar", 
           "James Clerk Maxwell Building", "Teviot", "Lidl", "Pleasance Gym")

places <- data.frame(lat = c(55.945870,55.942692,55.944491,55.964784,55.922238, 55.945231,55.945671,55.948242),
                     lng = c(-3.189610,-3.189005,-3.187020,-3.173684,-3.171259, -3.188786, -3.184314,-3.180689))
places %>%

  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = EdinIcon, 
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
             popup = Names)
